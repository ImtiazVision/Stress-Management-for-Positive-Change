### Defination of Stress 

**Stress** : The gap between demand and capacity is referred to as stress. The disparity between demand and capabilityÂ will lead to stress.

### Is stress good or bad?

Stress is neither beneficial nor negative in and of itself. It is determined by how we respond to stress. Stress may promote development if we respond to it in a good and healthy way. However, if we don't handle it appropriately, it might lead to burnout.

### The Mind Is King

#### Brain rules : 

1. We are genetically programmed to be cautious.

2. There are several methods for processing information (conscious and nonconscious).

3. To navigate events, the triune brain collaborates.
