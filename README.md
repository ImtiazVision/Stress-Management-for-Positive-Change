### Defination of Stress 

**Stress** : The gap between demand and capacity is referred to as stress. The disparity between demand and capability will lead to stress. It provides us with knowledge and energy that we may utilize to make adjustments. It isn't really a sensation; it's an insight that we can act on, and when we do, that's when we can utilize stress for good.

### Is stress good or bad?

Stress is neither beneficial nor negative in and of itself. It is determined by how we respond to stress. Stress may promote development if we respond to it in a good and healthy way. However, if we don't handle it appropriately, it might lead to burnout.

### The Mind Is King

#### Brain rules : 

1. We are genetically programmed to be cautious.

2. There are several methods for processing information (conscious and nonconscious).

3. To navigate events, the triune brain collaborates.

**Modern Monkey Mind**: Our brains swing from one branch to the next, hopping about without stop, as the name "monkey mind" suggests. We're switching between conversations, social media, email, brief job chores, and a search for something we're interested in, from dozens of messages to dozens of posts to a few dozen browser tabs. All day long, we bounce from one simple task to the next, putting off anything that required a lot more concentration.Our brains swing from one branch to the next, hopping about without stop, as the name "monkey mind" suggests.

### Stress is addictive 

Stress, like other addictive substances such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, and smoking, works on the same reward circuits in the brain.
